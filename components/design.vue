    <h2>Design</h2>

    <p>We are creating a high range, autonomous drone with VTOL capabilitys. The Frame is based on a Skywalker X8 design, a flying wing plane.</p>
    <p>The aircraft is going to be made out of carbon fiber with 3D printed, easily swappable parts. The sensors are arranged in modules that can be replaced as needed. The Batterys are state of the art lithium ion cells that last for 1 hour of flight time and charge very fast.</p>
    <p>The aircraft sould have a high end GPS antenna and LTE connectivity.  With this and all the other sensors the Aircraft is able to operate over long distances while still having a constant connection to the controll station.</p>
    <p>The rotors are able to rotate vertical for flying or horizontally for vertical takeoff and landing. In case of an emergency the plane can recover from free fall using the hover mode while gliding mode allows the plane to fly long distances efficently.</p>
