    <h2>Safety</h2>
    <p>We are designing the Aircraft with high security standards. All critical Parts are going to be redundant. If no safe landing is possible, the Plane is going to have a parachute, that deploys automaticaly, when the aircraft is decending beyond a critical vertical speed. The parachute can also be deployed from the control station if nessesary.</p>
